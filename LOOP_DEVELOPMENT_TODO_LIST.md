- [x] **MOVE** constants to `src/shared/constants/`

#### Day 2: App-Level Structure
- [x] **MOVE** navigation to `src/app/navigation/`
- [x] **MOVE** store setup to `src/app/store/`
- [x] **MOVE** theme to `src/app/theme/`
- [x] **MOVE** contexts to `src/app/contexts/`

#### Day 3: Update Imports & Test
- [x] Update all import statements to use new shared structure
- [x] Ensure all existing functionality still works
- [x] Test app thoroughly after restructuring

### Phase 2: Move All Entry Types (Days 4-6) ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Move all existing entry types to feature folders (except loops)

- [x] Move Actions Feature
- [x] Move Notes Feature  
- [x] Move Paths Feature
- [x] Move Sagas Feature
- [x] Move Sparks Feature

### Phase 3: Create New Loop Implementation (Days 7-12) ‚úÖ
**Goal**: Implement complete new loop feature with background execution

#### Day 7: Core Types & Services ‚úÖ
- [x] Create comprehensive loop types (`src/shared/types/loop.ts`)
- [x] Build ExecutionEngine service (background execution core)
- [x] Build BackgroundTaskManager service
- [x] Build ExecutionStorage service  
- [x] Build NotificationManager service

#### Days 8-9: Loop Screens ‚úÖ
- [x] Create LoopListScreen (main loops display)
- [x] Create LoopDetailScreen (loop information & management)
- [x] Create LoopExecutionScreen (real-time execution interface)
- [x] Create LoopBuilderScreen (loop creation & editing)

#### Days 10-11: Core Components & Hooks ‚úÖ
- [x] Create LoopCard component (loop display)
- [x] Create ActivityList component (activity management)
- [x] Create ActivityCard component (activity display)
- [x] Create useLoops hook (loop CRUD operations)
- [x] Create execution components (ExecutionTimer, ExecutionProgress, ExecutionControls)
- [x] Create builder components (ActivityBuilder, LoopSettings, LoopPreview)
- [x] Create utility components (LoopFiltersModal, ExecutionHistoryList, LoopStats)

#### Day 12: State Management ‚úÖ
- [x] Create Redux slices for loops, execution, templates, and builder
- [x] Implement comprehensive selectors with memoization
- [x] Create typed hooks for Redux integration
- [x] Set up proper state persistence and optimistic updates
- [x] Add state synchronization between components

### Phase 4: Integration and Testing (Days 13-15) ‚è≥
**Goal**: Integrate all features and test the complete system

#### Day 13: Feature Integration ‚è≥
- [x] Update main Redux store to include all loop slices
- [x] Integrate loop screens into navigation system
- [x] Update VaultLoopsScreen to use new loop components
- [x] Update HomeScreen to include loop functionality
- [x] Create ExecutionHeader component for app-wide loop status
- [x] Integrate ExecutionHeader into AppNavigator
- [ ] Test cross-feature navigation and functionality
- [ ] Validate shared component usage across all features

#### Day 14: Background Execution Testing
- [ ] Test loop execution across app navigation
- [ ] Test loop execution during app backgrounding
- [ ] Test loop execution recovery after app closure
- [ ] Test timer accuracy and persistence

#### Day 15: Final Testing and Optimization
- [ ] Performance testing across all features
- [ ] Memory leak testing
- [ ] Error handling testing
- [ ] Theme consistency validation
- [ ] Shared component usage validation

## üîÑ Recent Progress

### Day 13 Progress - Feature Integration
**Completed:**
- ‚úÖ **Store Integration**: Updated main Redux store to include all loop slices (loopSlice, executionSlice, templateSlice, builderSlice)
- ‚úÖ **Navigation Integration**: Added all loop screens to AppNavigator (LoopListScreen, LoopDetailScreen, LoopBuilderScreen, LoopExecutionScreen)
- ‚úÖ **VaultLoopsScreen Update**: Integrated new loop components and Redux hooks, replaced placeholder with full functionality
- ‚úÖ **HomeScreen Integration**: Added loop data loading, recent loop entries, and "Create Loop" quick action
- ‚úÖ **ExecutionHeader Component**: Created compact execution status header with controls (pause/resume, skip, open execution)
- ‚úÖ **App-wide Execution Status**: Integrated ExecutionHeader into AppNavigator for persistent loop execution visibility

**Key Features Implemented:**
- Complete loop navigation flow from Vault ‚Üí Detail ‚Üí Builder ‚Üí Execution
- Real-time execution status display across the entire app
- Seamless integration with existing entry type patterns
- Proper theme token usage throughout all new components

**Next Steps:**
- Test cross-feature navigation and functionality
- Validate shared component usage across all features

## üö® Critical Requirements
- **NO hardcoded colors** - ALL components must use theme tokens
- **Shared components first** - Check existing library before creating new
- **Background execution** - Loops only, must persist across app lifecycle
- **Theme consistency** - 100% compliance across all features
