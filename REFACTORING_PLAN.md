MindKnot Refactoring Plan

1. Component Architecture Standardization
1.1 Create Atomic Design Structure
Reorganize src/components/common into atomic design principles:
atoms/: Basic building blocks (Button, Icon, Typography, Tag)
molecules/: Combinations of atoms (CategoryPill, Card)
organisms/: Complex UI sections (FilterableList, DetailScreenHeader)
templates/: Page layouts with content placeholders
1.2 Component API Consistency
Implement consistent props interfaces across similar components
Add TypeScript prop interfaces with full JSDoc documentation
Create shared prop types for commonly used patterns

2. State Management Refinement
2.1 Develop Unified Store Pattern
Create consistent Zustand store implementation for all entity types
Implement shared store creator functions with common CRUD operations
Extract filter/sort/view state into reusable store
2.2 Custom Hook Library
Create reusable hooks package for common UI patterns:
useFilterableList: Extract filter logic from screens
useEntityCRUD: Standard CRUD operations for entities
useSortableData: Sorting logic abstraction

3. Common UI Patterns
3.1 Extract Shared Patterns
Create BaseEntityScreen template for all entity screens
Implement EntityForm factory to standardize form creation
Develop reusable search/filter components
3.2 Navigation Patterns
Standardize navigation structure with consistent route definitions
Create route factories for common navigation patterns
4. Theme System Improvements

4.1 Tokens and Variables
Create comprehensive theme token system
Implement design system variables
Ensure consistent spacing and layout patterns
4.2 Theme Utils
Create theme utilities for common patterns (e.g., elevation, color manipulation)
Implement accessibility helpers for contrast checking

5. Data Layer Abstraction
5.1 Repositories and Services
Create entity repositories to abstract database operations
Implement service layer for business logic
Standardize data transformation/normalization

Implementation Plan
Start with theme system improvements (4)
Implement atomic design structure (1.1)
Create shared hooks and store patterns (2)
Standardize component APIs (1.2)
Extract common UI patterns (3)
Implement data layer abstractions (5)
